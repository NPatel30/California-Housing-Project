# California-Housing-Project
## Introduction:
Housing prices in California vary significantly based on factors such as location, income levels, and housing density. This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate median housing prices using a dataset that includes key socioeconomic and geographical variables.
## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts housing prices in different regions of California. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced modeling techniques, the project explores the most influential factors affecting real estate values.
## Key Steps in the Project:
### Data Exploration & Preprocessing:
•	Understanding dataset distributions, missing values, and feature correlations.

•	Handling data cleaning and transformations to improve model performance.

### Feature Engineering:

•	Creating new features to enhance predictive power, such as:

•	Bedrooms_per_Room: Captures the density of bedrooms per total rooms.

•	Population_per_Occupant: Measures the number of people per household.

•	Income_HouseAge_Interaction: An interaction term between median income and house age.

### Model Selection & Training:
•	Implementing XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to capture complex relationships in the data.

•	Evaluating feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to housing price predictions.

### Insights & Business Implications:

•	Identifying how location, income, and housing density impact real estate pricing.

•	Providing recommendations for real estate investors, policymakers, and urban developers based on predictive insights.

# Final Observations & Conclusion 

## 1. Feature Importance Insights
### Geographical Features (Latitude & Longitude) are the Most Influential:

•	The model heavily relies on location, indicating that housing prices in California are largely determined by regional factors (e.g., coastal vs. inland areas, urban vs. rural).

### Median Income (MedInc) is a Strong Predictor:

•	As expected, wealthier neighborhoods tend to have higher housing prices.

### Engineered Features Provided Additional Value:

•	The interaction term (Income_HouseAge_Interaction) contributed significantly to model performance.

•	Bedrooms_per_Room and Population_per_Occupant had moderate importance, showing that housing density and occupancy patterns affect pricing.

## 2. Model Performance
### XGBoost Provided Strong Predictive Power:

•	Tree-based models like XGBoost effectively captured non-linear relationships in the data.

•	Further fine-tuning (e.g., hyperparameter optimization) could further improve accuracy.

### Potential Areas for Model Improvement:

•	Feature selection might help remove less useful features.

•	Additional feature engineering (e.g., polynomial interactions) could capture more nuanced effects.

Testing different models (e.g., SVM, neural networks) might provide different perspectives on the problem.

## 3. Business & Real-World Implications

### Housing Prices are Primarily Driven by Location & Income Levels:

•	Policymakers and real estate developers should focus on income distribution and regional development when analyzing housing trends.

### Age of Houses Has Limited Direct Impact:

•	While newer homes may have some advantage, income and location play a much bigger role in pricing.

### Model Could Be Used for Predicting Future Trends:

•	The trained model can help estimate housing prices for new listings or forecast price trends in different regions.

## Final Conclusion
Geographical factors and income levels are the dominant drivers of housing prices.

Feature engineering improves model performance, and interaction terms can provide valuable insights.

The XGBoost model performs well, but additional refinement can further enhance predictions.
